## Ubuntu
Most of the commands above are written for Red Hat-based systems. 
Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu) are similar, but some commands may differ slightly.
- adduser : add user
- export EDITOR=vim : default editor is nano (if you want to change editor)
- dpkg : manual manage package
  - --> -i : install
  - --> -r : remove
- apt install : auto manage package
- apt remove : auto remove package
- apt purge : auto remove package cleanly
