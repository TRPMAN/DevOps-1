# 🐧 Linux Learning

Welcome to the Linux part of my DevOps learning journey! 🚀

In this branch, I document what I’ve learned about working with Linux, focusing on essential command-line skills that are foundational for any DevOps engineer.

## 📁 Topics

1. [Good to Know](./0_Good-to-Know.md) – Basic concepts and tips
2. [Important Directories](./1_Important Directory.md) – Overview of Linux directory structure
3. [Basic Commands](./2_Basic-Command.md) – Frequently used command-line tools
4. [Vim Editor](./3_Vim-Editor.md) – Getting started with Vim
5. [File System](./4_File-System.md) – Structure and file management
6. [Filters](./5_Filter.md) – `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `cut`, etc.

This is my hands-on space to explore and practice core Linux concepts that are essential in any DevOps environment.
