# EC2
Some useful command
- ssh -i <key path> <user>@<public ip> : SSH into EC2 instance

## AMI
For saving an EC2 instance state

## Lanuch Template
For saving launch configuration like AMI, instance type, networking, storage settings, etc. to easily start EC2 instances. Some services like Auto Scaling Group require using a Launch Template

## Elastic Block Storage(EBS)
After creating and attaching new EBS volume to an EC2 instance, you need to format and mount it before it can be used by the file system.
- fdisk -l : List all available hard disks
- df -h : Show mounted file systems 
- fdisk <disk-path> : Create a new partition on the disk
- mkfs : Show format partition 
- mkfs<select-format> <disk-path> : Format the partition with a file system
- mount <path> <target-mount-path> : Mount the partition to a target directory
- unmount <target-mounted-path> : Unmount the partition
- vi /etc/fstab : Edit for permanent mounting at boot
  - <partition-path> <target-mount-path> <type> <option> 0 0
Snapshots for backup that EBS

## Elastic Load Balancer<ELB>
This is a manual step for creating for ELB for exist EC2 instance
- First Create Target Group, Select the exist EC2 Instance
- Create SG for ELB and Create ELB
- Attach ELB-SG into EC2-SG inbound rule

## Auto Scaling Group<ASG>
This is a manual step for creating for ASG
- Choose launch template
- Choose network and Zone
- Choose ELB *In health check should Turn on ELB health checks because ASG cannot check EC2 status by itself
- Configure group size and scaling
  - Desired Cap : Number that ASG will maintain this instance level
  - MIn Desired Cap : It cannot go lower than this
  - Max Desired Cap : It cannot go higher than this
  - Choose Matric to Automate Scaling like Average CPU Utilization
  - Choose Instance maintenance policy
- Add noti and tags

In target group if you want to user still login to the same EC2 instance
- go to Attributes -> edit
- Turn on Stickiness

## Security Group<SG>
- inbound : traffic come in to instance
- outbound : traffic come out from instance

## Elastic Ip
- for the static public ip
